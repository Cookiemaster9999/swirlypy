## For Developers

swirlypy is a Python package, meaning that its directory must be
located somewhere in your Python path. For individuals with sane
directory structures, this likely means temporarily adding the path to
the directory above swirlypy's to your `$PYTHONPATH`. Alternatively,
you could add a symlink from an existing Python directory. Eventually,
we should be able to install swirlypy as a package and avoid this issue,
but for the moment this is the workaround.
